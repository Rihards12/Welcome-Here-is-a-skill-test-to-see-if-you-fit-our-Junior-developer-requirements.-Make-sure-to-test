Assignments
Hello!
We are happy our company took your attention, however it is not the only thing we are
expecting from you. We have created a trial for you, to prove your bravery.
General requirements:
PHP: ^7.0, plain classes, no frameworks, OOP approach jQuery: optional
jQuery-UI: prohibited
Bootstrap - optional
SASS - advantage
MySQL: ^5.6 - obligatory
PSR-1/2 - optional
Code should be shared as bitbucket repository that is shared with a user whose email is as
follows: hr@scandiweb.com

Task description:
The expected outcome is 2 separate pages for:
1) product list
2) product add
1. Product list should list all existing product and details, like:
● SKU (unique for each product)
● Name
● Price
Also each product type has special attribute, which we expect you would be able to display as
well (one of based on type):
● Size (in MB) for DVD-disc
● Weight (in Kg) for Book
● Dimensions (HxWxL) for Furniture
An advantage would be implementation of the optional feature: mass delete action,
implemented as checkboxes next to each product.
Here is an example of product list page:

2. Product add page should display a form, with following fields
● SKU
● Name
● Price
● Type switcher (buttons for each type)
● Special attribute [please note: the form should be dynamically changed when
type is switched]
Additional notes:
- Special attribute should have a description with helpful information, related to its type
ex.: “Please provide dimensions in HxWxL format”, when type: Furniture is selected.
- Utilize OOP principles to handle differences in type logic/behavior.
- Meeting PSR standards is an advantage (https://www.php-fig.org)
Additional requirements:
- All fields are mandatory for submission.
- Avoid using conditional statements for handling differences in product types.
An advantage would be fields value (or format whether suitable) validation.
Here is an example of product add page:
